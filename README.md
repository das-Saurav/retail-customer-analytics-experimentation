# Retail Customer Analytics & Experimentation Case Study

## Overview
This project replicates a real-world retail analytics engagement completed as part of the **Quantium Data Analytics Job Simulation on Forage**.  
The objective was to analyse customer purchasing behaviour, evaluate a store layout trial, and deliver data-driven commercial recommendations for the Chips category.

## Business Problem
- Understand key drivers of chip sales across customer segments
- Evaluate the effectiveness of a new in-store layout using trial vs control stores
- Provide actionable recommendations to support category strategy decisions

## Project Structure
- **Task 1:** Data preparation and customer analytics
- **Task 2:** Experimentation and uplift testing
- **Task 3:** Client-ready reporting using Pyramid Principle

## Key Analytics Performed
- Data cleaning and feature engineering on large transaction datasets
- Customer segmentation by lifestage and affluence
- Control store selection using correlation and magnitude distance
- Uplift testing to evaluate trial store performance
- Translation of analytics into commercial recommendations

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- PowerPoint (client reporting)

## Key Outcome
- Identified customer volume as the primary driver of category sales
- Found statistically significant sales uplift in one trial store
- Recommended a targeted rollout strategy based on store characteristics
